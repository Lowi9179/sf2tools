A tool pack for a Game - Shadow Fight 2

- **Current version:** 0.3.3
- **Max game version:** 1.9.21
- **Last update:** 31.03.2020

> At the moment, the project is only **in development** and now only one tool is available: **Node Tool**. In this regard, the application is adapted only for smartphones.

This web application allows you to quickly work with modifications of the game. For example, in Node Tool the application will calculate everything LCC in your node. In other tools, the application will save you time to create code, because the program will do everything by itself. For greater convenience, it is recommended to install WebAPK. It can be installed in the "About the application" page. (top-right button)
